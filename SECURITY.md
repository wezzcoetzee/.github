# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report vulnerabilities privately via [GitHub Security Advisories](../../security/advisories/new). This keeps the disclosure confidential until a fix is available.

Include:
- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

## Response SLA

| Severity | Initial Response | Target Fix |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| Critical | 24 hours | 7 days |
| High | 48 hours | 14 days |
| Medium | 5 days | 30 days |
| Low | 10 days | Next release |

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version on `main` receives security fixes.

## Disclosure Policy

Once a fix is merged and released, a security advisory will be published crediting the reporter (unless they prefer to remain anonymous).
